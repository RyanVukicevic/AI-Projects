# Fake News Detection by Headline (LSTM + Keras/TensorFlow)

## Overview
This project predicts whether a news headline is **real** or **fake** using deep learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP).  
It uses an **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** neural network to capture sequential patterns in text data and achieves **~99% accuracy** on the test set.

---

## Dataset
- **Source:** [Fake and Real News Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset?resource=download&select=Fake.csv)
- **Data Used:** Only the `title` and `label` columns (label: `1` = real, `0` = fake)

---

## Process
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Combined real and fake datasets, labeled them.
   - Tokenized and converted text to integer sequences.
   - Applied padding to ensure uniform input length.
2. **Model Architecture**
   - Embedding layer (vector representation of words)
   - LSTM layer (64 units)
   - Dropout (0.5) for regularization
   - Dense output layer with Sigmoid activation (binary classification)
3. **Training**
   - Optimized with `adam` optimizer, `binary_crossentropy` loss.
   - Early stopping by monitoring validation loss.
4. **Evaluation**
   - Achieved ~99% accuracy and low binary crossentropy loss.

## Results
- **Accuracy:** ~99%
- **Loss:** ~0.13 (test set)
- Model generalized well with minimal overfitting.

## Interactive Demo
The script includes a CLI quiz where:
- A random headline is shown.
- You guess if it’s **real** or **fake**.
- The model’s prediction, confidence, and correct label are displayed.
