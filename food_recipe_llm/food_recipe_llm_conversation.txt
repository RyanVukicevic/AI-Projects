Query: pizza recipe

Answer: Title: Classic Margherita Pizza
Ingredients:
- 2 pkg. pizza dough mix
- 1 jar marinara sauce
- Fresh basil leaves
- 1 ball buffalo mozzarella cheese
- Extra virgin olive oil
- Salt

Directions:
1. Preheat your oven to its highest setting, typically around 475°F (246°C). If you have a pizza stone, put it in the oven now too.
2. On a lightly floured surface, stretch or roll out one package of pizza dough into an approximately 12-inch circle. Transfer the dough onto a piece of parchment paper if using a baking sheet; otherwise, transfer directly onto a preheated pizza stone.
3. Spread half of the marinara sauce evenly across the base of the pizza, leaving a border around the edges free from sauce.
4. Slice the buffalo mozzarella into thin rounds and distribute them evenly over the sauce. Add some torn fresh basil leaves among the tomato sauce and cheese. Drizzle extra virgin olive oil generously over everything. Season with a pinch of salt.
5. Carefully slide the pizza (with the parchment underneath if used) onto the middle rack of the oven. Bake for about 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden and puffy and the cheese has started to bubble and turn slightly golden.
6. Remove the pizza from the oven carefully – use caution when handling the hot pizza! Let it cool for a few minutes before cutting into wedges and serving immediately while still warm. Enjoy your homemade classic margherita pizza!

Query: pasta recipe

Answer: Title: Creamy Mushroom Spinach Pasta
Ingredients:
- 8 oz. bow tie pasta
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 small shallot, finely chopped
- 2 cups fresh spinach leaves, roughly chopped
- 8 oz. button mushrooms, thinly sliced
- 1 cup heavy cream
- Salt and black pepper, to taste
- Grated parmesan cheese, for serving

Directions:
1. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente. Reserve one cup of pasta water before draining. Set aside.
2. Meanwhile, in a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the shallots and sauté until softened, around 2-3 minutes. Stir in the mushrooms and continue to cook until they release their moisture and begin to brown, approximately 6-7 minutes. Season with salt and pepper as needed.
3. Lower the heat slightly then gradually whisk in the heavy cream. Allow it to come to a gentle simmer while continuously stirring. If your sauce is too thick, you may use some reserved pasta water to reach desired consistency. Simmer for another 2-3 minutes.
4. Once the sauce has thickened, fold in the chopped spinach and allow it to wilt from the residual heat of the sauce - take care that no excessive liquid remains atop the sauce. Adjust seasoning if necessary.
5. Combine the hot pasta with the creamy mushroom spinach sauce ensuring each strand gets coated evenly. Serve immediately garnished generously with grated parmesan cheese. Enjoy!

Query: salad recipe

Answer: Title: Classic Cobb Salad
Ingredients:
- 1 head romaine lettuce, washed and chopped
- 1 avocado, ripe but firm, peeled, pitted, and cubed
- 1 tomato, cored and diced
- 1 hard-boiled egg, halved
- 1/2 cup blue cheese crumbles
- 1/2 cup fresh basil leaves, roughly chopped
- Salt and black pepper to taste
- Your favorite dressing (optional), e.g., Ranch, Blue Cheese, Balsamic Vinaigrette

Directions:
1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the chopped romaine lettuce, avocado, tomato, and half of the hard-boiled egg halves. Add salt and black pepper to your liking.
2. Sprinkle over the blue cheese crumbles and fresh basil leaves. Gently toss everything together until well combined. If desired, drizzle some of your chosen dressing over the salad just before serving. Serve immediately as it's best enjoyed when chilled. Enjoy!

Note: This classic Cobb salad is perfect for any occasion - from casual lunches at home to elegant dinner parties. Feel free to customize according to personal preferences by adding other proteins like grilled chicken breast or turkey sausage, roasted vegetables such as zucchini or sweet potatoes, or even nuts like walnuts or pecans for extra texture and flavor.
